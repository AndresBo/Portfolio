# Portfolio


A personal portfolio website designed to present my skills and showcase my work. It was designed using **HTML** and vanilla **CSS**.

## Basic CSS design guidelines:
- Added some **resets** copied from (https://gist.github.com/Asjas/4b0736108d56197fce0ec9068145b421)
- Only one CSS file was used. In the future I would like to divide it using SCSS but at the moment I want to focus on learning vanilla CSS.
- Font size: 18px (1.125 rem) defined in the body.
- Font family: Be Vietnam Pro
