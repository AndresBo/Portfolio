# Portfolio


A personal portfolio website designed to present my skills and showcase my work.

Here is a very simple wireframe for my portfolio built using [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/file/m4qT6pQFJhMUwgO150SbAy/Portafolio-Website?node-id=0%3A1).
<br>

I'm not a designer. Design cues for my website were taken from the following website:(https://web.archive.org/web/20190213060110/https://timmyomahony.com/)

The website will have four web pages: **home**, **contact**, **blog**, and **projects**. The website will use the same layout for all web pages, sharing the same header and footer.

## Basic CSS design guidelines:
### widths: 
  - mobile: 375px
  - desktop: 1440px 

### Font size body: 16px

### Font family: Be Vietnam Pro

weights: 400, 500, 700
