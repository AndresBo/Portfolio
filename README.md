# Portfolio


A personal portfolio website designed to present my skills and showcase my work. It was designed using **HTML** and vanilla **CSS**.

Here is a very simple wireframe for my portfolio built using [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/file/m4qT6pQFJhMUwgO150SbAy/Portafolio-Website?node-id=0%3A1).

Design inspiration for my portfolio website were taken from the following website:(https://web.archive.org/web/20190213060110/https://timmyomahony.com/)

The website will have four main web pages: **home**, **contact**, **blog**, and **projects**. The website will use the same layout for all web pages, sharing the same header and footer. The **blog post page** links to individial blog post articles.

The layout will be quite simple. Designed to be reused across all different pages and also made to provide ease of accessibilty by using **CSS flexbox** layout.

## Basic CSS design guidelines:
- Added some **resets** copied from (https://gist.github.com/Asjas/4b0736108d56197fce0ec9068145b421)
- Only one CSS file was used. In the future I would like to divide it using SCSS but at the moment I want to focus on learning vanilla CSS.
- Font size: 18px (1.125 rem) defined in the body.
- Font family: Be Vietnam Pro
